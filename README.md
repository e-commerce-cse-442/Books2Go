# Books2Go Documentation

we used reactjs, Nodejs, express and Postgresql in this project.

Nodejs: All of our backend stuff is running with node server. To get started with node, you have to install node and npm in you local machine. run "npm install -g npm" to do that. 

Express: We used a node library express for our API stuff. install express by running "npm install express". You'll see we imported express on our server.js. And there is already a post and get request on server. 

reactjs: All of our frontend stuff is with reactjs. To get started with reactjs you have to install react by running this command npm install create_react_app.

Postgresql: We used postgresql as our database. you can get the database credentials from our heroku app. Also download pgAdmin to see the tables.
